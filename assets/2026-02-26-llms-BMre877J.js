`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`Ever since ChatGPT shook the world in late 2022, as a data scientist and linguist, the single question I was asked the most was "What do you think about LLMs? Do you think they would work in 5 years? Do you think they're worth investing in?" etc. Having studied neural networks and transformers in a data science context, I did know some things about how LLMs work, but I didn't feel expertly enough to form my beliefs at the time. As we draw close to the 5-year mark, I see the picture more clearly, and my opinions have changed.`}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`Back in 2023, I was in the camp of "LLMs are just a fad". After all, they have proof of neither cognition nor inherent understanding of language; "they are just next-token predictors", as more and more people learned to say in the past few years. Languages are recursive; the sequential nature of LLMs can't build sentences the same way humans do, or at least how Chomsky believes they do. The very way in which they work is an abomination to the linguistic model we've been carefully building for decades. At that time, my vision for a "true AI" was still to build a bit-to-bit model of human cognition:`}),`

So perhaps it's time to reevaluate."]}),`
`,e.jsx(t.h2,{children:"Now"}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:[`As of 2026, my mind is no longer completely made up that there exists a single way to do cognition. Humans have some abstract notion of "thought" that's independent of language, and we pretend to know something about it, but in fact we know very little because everything about what we think must be manifested to the outside, through language, muscle movement, or something else. Brain imaging only works occasionally with not-great interpretability. How can we build a machine that thinks like us, if we don't even know how we think? On the other hand, perhaps language `,e.jsx(t.em,{children:"is"}),` a viable engine for driving thought. Think about this way: most machines operate based on a "working medium", whose movement/phase change transfers energy from the power source to the output. It can be water, steam, air, oil—doesn't matter. All that matters is that we need something that moves to drive the energy from point A to point B. Similarly, perhaps `,e.jsx(t.strong,{children:"language is viable as that working medium"}),", on which thought can be executed."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:[`I'm not sure how true it is for humans, but I don't think it's completely off, either. It's tempting to bring up deaf and nonverbal people as examples of "people thinking without language", but remember that losing spoken language doesn't mean losing the language faculty. Perhaps aphasia patients' cognitive capabilities are worth looking into, but it's hard to tell when they can't express themselves and can't understand complex instructions.`,e.jsx(t.sup,{children:e.jsx(t.a,{href:"#user-content-fn-2",id:"user-content-fnref-2","data-footnote-ref":!0,"aria-describedby":"footnote-label",children:"2"})}),` For most of us, "thinking out loud" is a thing, which isn't far from how LLMs work in terms of cognitive process. As another example: I know some people who can never answer questions like "does K come before N in the alphabet" on the spot, and they always have to chant the alphabet in their head to figure it out. This is akin to LLMs driving their thought by generating tokens; these tokens by themselves don't mean much, but they carry the thought from point A to point B, until we arrive at a plausible answer.`]}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:[`Of course, there's also the question of "do LLMs actually know how to speak". On this point, I'm more certain: yes, they do. There's no recursive data structure being built, but the very way the attention mechanism works is reminiscent of how we process language. We don't have a single "stack" of words that we build up and tear down as we parse sentences; instead, we keep track of certain dependencies between words, most of them closed instantly (such as "closed" and "instantly") and don't need to be memorized, only a few of them open for a long time (such as "stack of words" and "tear down"). In this sense, attention also enables effect-at-a-distance, a hallmark of human language. If AI learns that "an" can only be followed by words starting with a vowel, "he" must be followed by a verb ending with -s, and a "what" must be paired with a gap somewhere later in the sentence, then `,e.jsx(t.strong,{children:"it's hard to claim that it hasn't learned the language"}),`, even if we can't point to a specific data structure in its "brain" that corresponds to that process.`]}),`
`,e.jsx(t.h2,{children:"Future"}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["Suppose that LLMs are indeed the way to go. ",e.jsx("abbr",{title:"Model Context Protocol",children:"MCP"}),' already provides the capability of interfacing with arbitrary tools, similar to motor control. Multi-modal attention already provides the capability of processing arbitrary sensory input, at least visual, textual, and (to a limited extent) auditory. The whole agentic architecture is apt for coordinating complex tasks. But for LLMs to truly be "thinking", I think at least we need two more things: internally, a sense of ',e.jsx(t.strong,{children:'"truth"/"doctrine"/"belief"'})," (however you'd like to call it) to fix hallucinations, and externally, a sense of ",e.jsx(t.strong,{children:'"causality"'})," to understand the evolution of states. These are grand problems to solve, but I think we are solidly moving in that direction."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["I do know that there are people actively researching the cognitive science of LLMs—for example, ",e.jsx(t.a,{href:"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/psmo/",children:"Paul Smolensky"}),`, from whom I heard a colloquium talk on whether AI falsifies generative linguistics. I won't pretend to know more about this than average people, because my linguistics upbringing does not include much about either cognitive science or LLMs. I also know that many AI researchers continue to be unconvinced by LLMs, most famously Yann LeCun, who pursue things like "world models". Of course, that would be the ultimate dream of all of us, but until we reach there, I've at least persuaded myself that LLMs have a promising future ahead.`]}),`
