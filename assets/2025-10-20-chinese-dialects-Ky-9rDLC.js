As a simple example: the third person singular pronoun is 他 (tā) in Mandarin, 佢 (keoi5) in Cantonese, and 伊 (i1) in Wu.

Similarly, I can accept the idea of Abstand vs. Ausbau languages, but it should be understood that the latter has no say of linguistics.`}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:`My biggest qualm with the "dialect" theory as applied to Chinese is that it bends the language classification framework in a way that makes it less useful for no apparent gains. If 粤语, 吴语, 闽南语, and 普通话 are all dialects of the same language, then what's 广府粤语 and 莞宝粤语? What's 太湖片吴语 and 台州片吴语? If we call mutually unintelligible languages with distinct lexical, phonological, and syntactic features the same "language", then what term is left for actually mutually-intelligible varieties?`}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:`Looking in the other direction of classification: we know that French, Spanish, and Italian are all Romance languages; if we assume that "French" is of the same status as "Chinese", then what's the equivalent of "Romance languages" for Chinese? It appears that immediately above "Chinese" is the whole Sino-Tibetan language family (which is the equivalent of "Indo-European languages")—we made a huge jump from a major language family to a concrete language and then to its "dialects", with no intermediate levels permitted. Scientifically, I don't find that an aesthetically pleasing taxonomy.`}),`
