`,e.jsx(t.li,{children:"It has primitive syntax and semantics, so there are relatively few prerequisites before one can write meaningful and idiomatic code."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.li,{children:"Its lack of standard libraries is a feature, because it forces students to implement data structures and algorithms from scratch."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.li,{children:"It is a common language in systems programming."}),`
`]}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["I believe that point 1 has been objectively proven irrelevant.

In that sense, C is actually a hindrance to learn PL concepts, because idioms (i.e., workarounds for the lack of a feature) you use here may already be obsolete in other languages."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["Point 2 is a façade of the many practices in education that I hate because they attempt to work against the students. They first presuppose that there are certain skills that students must have, and then they force students to acquire those skills by making them do things the hard way.",e.jsx(t.sup,{children:e.jsx(t.a,{href:"#user-content-fn-1",id:"user-content-fnref-1","data-footnote-ref":!0,"aria-describedby":"footnote-label",children:"1"})}),` But if students need to be "forced" into learning something by taking existing tools away from them, it's time to reconsider if said thing is worth learning at all. When was the last time someone working on real software had to implement their own array list, hash map, or quicksort? Demonstrating the implementation of these data structures and algorithms can be done in any language; why do we have to do it under the pretense of real-life necessity?`]}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`There's another problem with point 2: the "reinvent the wheel" mindset is actively dangerous in today's programming world, because nothing actually works the way you are taught and have been trained to implement. For example, the state-of-the-art sorting algorithm is usually not quicksort, but usually a hybrid sort that guarantees (1) good performance on small arrays, (2) stability, (3) in-place, (4) good cache performance, and (5) good asymptotic performance. If you write quicksort from muscle memory, you just accidentally introduced overhead to both your code and your development process. The same goes for data structures: it's far too easy to write linked lists or hash maps with bugs.`}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`Points 3 and 4 should be taken together because they use C as an embodiment of the underlying machine architecture. I can't deny that compilers, systems, and computer architecture are a must-learn for CS majors, but I doubt that C is the best way to be introduced to these concepts, especially if it's used for non-demonstration purposes. I acknowledge that C is used for canonical examples of memory addressing, call stacks, linking, etc., and I can't find a better alternative. But again, let us separate "demonstration" from "practice". Think about C as those fancy Latin phrases in law: they can be used to embody abstract concepts, but there shouldn't be a need for students to write full articles in Latin, because 99% of the time spent is with irrelevant, frivolous details of the language.`}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`Finally, point 5 is a chicken-and-egg problem. It's not that we haven't successfully phased out other "mainstream industrial languages": think about COBOL, Fortran, Visual Basic, etc. C's status today is largely due to path dependency: it's because we have raised generations of engineers to think of C as the gospel of systems programming that they continue to produce, maintain, and consume C code. If they have been conditioned to think of alternatives, perhaps the outcome would be different. In fact, many "systems programming" tasks today are already transitioning to Rust (despite some resistance); it's no longer a revolutionary idea to write a kernel, browser, database, or compiler in non-C languages. Finally, very, very few students today actually enter their software engineering careers working on systems programming; most of them will be working on web development, data science, machine learning, etc., where C is not the lingua franca.`}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`I'm not arguing that CS education should be vocational training, though. I need to make it clear that I'm in the opposite camp: CS education should teach exactly those skills one can't pick up on a job. For example, I'm a big proponent of teaching formal languages, automata theory, and functional programming in the core curriculum. I have taken classes that write entire projects in Haskell, Racket, or Rocq. The problem with doing the same with C is that it offers no real insight about program paradigms and software design; students' time is spent on wrangling with errors preventable with better PL design, under the belief that "this is a necessary rite of passage for good programmers". But skill issues should be solved by programming languages, not programmers; learn to push your burden onto the language and library designers, not onto yourself.`}),`
`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["To rehash, let me state my position clearly: ",e.jsx(t.strong,{children:"C should have no place in the core CS curriculum as a working language for projects"}),". C consumes too much cognitive bandwidth on avoidable errors, crowding out deeper conceptual learning. It can be used for demonstration purposes, but any attention more than that implies it has anything of merit in today's programming world, which paints the wrong picture. Let us think about introducing the next generation of programmers to well-abstracted and rich languages suited to the task, let that be Python, Rust, or OCaml. And perhaps in another decade, we would be able to bid farewell to C once and for all."]}),`
