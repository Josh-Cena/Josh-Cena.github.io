There were two remarkable advancements in my CS skills in 2020: (1) I mastered Python to the proficiency of developing mathematical models individually (winning the IMMC competition the winter after); (2) I was tutored for competitive programming so I was fresh off the mint with Dijkstra, DP, etc. On the front of learning languages, I didn't learn any new languages beyond improving my Python, C++, and JavaScript skills, so I chose Python in retrospect for 2020."]}),`
