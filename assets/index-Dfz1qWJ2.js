In early 2022, out of boredom after college application, and inspired by everyone raving about functional programming™, I decided to learn Haskell via ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell",children:"Wikibooks"}),". AoC was a great way to try it out, especially since algorithm problems would involve far less fiddling with monads compared to IRL projects. I was very thankful for this experience: two years later, I took a ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"https://coursetable.com/catalog?course-modal=202403-10141",children:"software analysis and verification"})," class where half of my projects were written in Haskell, and I was immediately at home."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(a.p,{children:["Anyway, in 2022, I soon found out that I was inflicting pain on myself because I often have to wrap my head around doing things with tail recursion. BFS was intuitive to ",e.jsx(a.em,{children:"read"})," but not at all intuitive to ",e.jsx(a.em,{children:"write"}),", at least when I was new. There were a lot of folds, a lot of states being passed around, and a lot of inconsistency in my code style (despite using HLint). For example, ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/7/",children:"7"}),' would have been a trivial problem in mutable languages but was a bit verbose and error-prone in Haskell. Nevertheless, I would rate 2022 very high on my "enjoyment" scale because the code was always extremely neat and concise—features I highly value. Towards the latter half, I became very familiar with the language and it stopped being a hindrance.']}),`

I bailed on ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/15/",children:"15"}),", when I couldn't see clearly how to model it mathematically. Even in hindsight, 15 was a particularly hard problem especially at this numbering. ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/16/",children:"16"})," and ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/19/",children:"19"})," were very challenging among DP problems, especially because the pruning strategies for 19 were not obvious. ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/18/",children:"18"})," was not supposed to be a pain; half of the difficulty, IMO, came from using Haskell. ",e.jsx(a.a,{href:"/notes/aoc/2022/20/",children:"20"})," is brute-forceable but was significantly sped up with an order statistic tree, which the 2022 me couldn't have known existed. On the upside though, 21–25 were all very approachable, although I was already intimidated and didn't come back (also I was traveling around)."]}),`
