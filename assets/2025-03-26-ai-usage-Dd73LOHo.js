`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["As much as I'm reluctant to admit, the purpose of CS education is, largely, to prepare students for software development careers, so what we teach should be aligned with the skills that they need. I like comparing rejecting AI to people who rejected IDEs, code completion, and syntax highlighting 20 years ago, but I also think it's a completely different paradigm shift. The former is fundamentally shifting the way we interact with code. It's time to train our students to be proficient in this new paradigm, rather than teaching the new dog old tricks.

`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Most people—myself included—are terrible at beginning some task. I used to have this terrible habit, where I (as team lead) would ask someone to write a piece of code or writing, read it, and then write my own version without even copying theirs over. Building this mental scaffolding (or physical even, doesn't matter) significantly reduces this activation barrier and helps students see the full picture at a distance."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:'It transforms a "code-writing" task into a "code-reading" task. In my (unpopular) opinion, reading code is a more fundamental skill than writing code. (At least, people say that "code is read more than it is written".) It is also more transferable across languages and paradigms. By seeing the code that AI generates, students can learn new syntax and idioms that they might not have encountered before.'}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:`Let's take the scenario to its extreme and say the student blindly accepts the AI-generated code without even looking at it. How often this happens aside, I don't think it's a problem. Coding in 2025 is increasingly shifting towards "prompting" rather than "coding". If the student can then make all tests pass, fix style issues, and refactor for clarity, they have learned much more practical skills than if they had written the code from scratch (probably without a good understanding of what "good code" should look like in the first place).`}),`

For example, we can give students intractably big projects and ask them to design the architecture and high-level components, and then use AI to fill in the details. For this reason, when I host my lab sections, I highly emphasize the engineering pros and cons of each data structure, which is rarely covered in lectures."}),`

We should migrate to ",e.jsx("abbr",{title:"Test-Driven Development",children:"TDD"})," and make the goal to write good, comprehensive tests and use them to drive the development process."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.li,{children:"Focus on in-person skills: when the banal parts of coding are handled by AI, what remains to be done by humans are the interpersonal and collaborative aspects of software development.
