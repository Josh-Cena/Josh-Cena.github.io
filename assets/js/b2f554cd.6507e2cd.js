My deck is **Mega Knight Bait**, and it\'s almost dead right now in the meta.\\n\\n![Deck](./CR_deck.png)\\n\\nI picked up this deck in February, 2020, when I was at 4600 trophies. It dominated that arena since few opponents even had small spells. April was the paradise moment for this deck, when skeleton barrel got its speed buff\u2014it even rose to mid-meta. _(That was also the happiest period of my life!)_\\n\\nBut around July, I was almost giving up on this deck. I got crushed every time by valkeries, wizards, PEKKAs, anything. This deck is just weak on defense\u2014only four ground units, all air defense units prone to zaps and other spells, mega knight being the only control card; inconsistent on offense\u2014with one AOE unit from my opponent the entire push is shut down; and collecting three legendary cards was just an endless journey. I played mega knight miner wall breakers for one season (shortly after the prince and royal delivery buff, this deck was everywhere), but eventually switched back for no reason.\\n\\nI\'ve been playing this deck ever since\u2014not changing any card once. I did change my small spell from snowball to zap, though, in fear of all the skarmies and inferno towers around the arena, but never for any other card.\\n\\nAnd efforts payed back. I won CC 12 wins, season tournament 18 wins, etc., and consistently pushed further on ladder. Eventually when my inferno dragon was maxed, I reached 6K with my level 12 king tower. (It was so hard against goblin barrel decks! Mega knight bait already has a hard time against log bait.)\\n\\nSo to show my respect for this deck, let me announce the names of each card.\\n\\n- **Mega knight**. The ultimate solution, the last defense. My best friend since 2500 trophies as my second legendary and my first level 10 card. This is what makes this deck fundamentally different from other bait / cycle decks. 7 elixirs can easily shut down a 15-elixir push, and even save half of its HP for a counterpush if you back it up with anything!\\n- **Inferno dragon**. The perfect complement of mega knight. Shuts down any tank with ease, and has the second highest HP in this deck. When facing log bait, Mega knight + inferno dragon = tower down. It is simply satisfying seeing one inferno dragon draining out an entire tower.\\n- **Miner**. Dig, dig, dig! Whenever you defend a mini-push with goblin gangs or bats, just send a miner to protect these swarms, and you get a workable counterpush. Using zap to make the opponent\'s princess tower lock on to the miner can usually make your crippled inferno dragon surprisingly take out an entire tower. It\'s even great on defense\u2014same damage as bandit or fisherman.\\n- **Skeleton barrel**. The second offensive card on par with the miner. It can be used as a tank for swarms when the miner\'s not in hand, can kite air units, can be a small spell bait, can be used as a small spell itself against minion horde, and can even be used as a source of swarms against a PEKKA + Ewiz synthergy.\\n- **Goblin gang**. Probably the best swarm card. Defends prince, dark prince, battle ram... It is a card you don\'t pay much attention to (unlike skarmy) but usually saves you at last minute.\\n- **Spear goblins**. Cheap but versatile. Defends minion horde, goblin barrel, balloon, valkerie...\\n- **Bats**. Despite so many nerfs, it is still viable. Without a zap, snowball, or anti-air unit from the opponent, bats can take out most lone ground units. Mega knight + bats is always the best synthergy. (Except when facing graveyard, though, when you would rather pair mega knight with inferno dragon.)\\n- **Zap**. This is what makes a 5000 player different from a 7000 one. Snowball is cool on defense (better than the log IMO), but on offense zap is the best. Quickly clears swarms, makes your miner quickly take out a musketeer or wizard, resets inferno towers, makes the tower retarget, stuns the unit for 0.5 second... It is the X-factor in the game.\\n\\nNow that my goal of 6K is completed, the next milestones on my journey are:\\n\\n1. Level 13 king tower\\n2. Four maxed decks\\n3. 6300, 6600, 7000...\\n4. World ranking\\n5. GC 12 wins (I don\'t have many gems though)\\n\\nIt would not be an easy task, but I\'m on my way."},{"id":"/2021/04/25/lang","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/04/25/lang","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-25-lang.mdx","title":"Random thoughts on a new programming language","description":"I\'m just putting together some random thoughts that I wish to turn into a new programming language.

A lot of the syntax may have been realized by mathematical languages like Mathematica or Python.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n_Update_: I\'ve created a repo \ud83d\udc49 https://github.com/jc-verse/caroline \ud83d\udc48 and it has changed **a lot** from my design below. Feel free to star & follow the latest progress of this language!\\n\\n## Data types\\n\\nThis is a language mainly used for algorithms and maths. The data types are:\\n\\n- **Number** `-1.6`, `1/3`;\\n- **Boolean** `true`;\\n- **String** `\\"Hello\\"`;\\n- **Set** `{1, 2, 3}` (no duplicate value; no order);\\n- **Matrix** `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` (supports matrix operations; vectors are special names for n\xd71 or 1\xd7n matrices);\\n- **Function**.\\n\\n## Arithmetic\\n\\nApart from the typical integer and decimal types, number types also include **fractions**, **irrational numbers**, and **complex numbers**. The special number `infty` is used for sequence and function limits, as well as the result of division by zero.\\n\\nSince fractions preserve more precision than decimals, whenever a fraction is involved in an expression, the result will be a fraction. Integers are special fractions with denominator of 1.\\n\\n```java\\nnum a := 1.6;\\nnum b := 1/3;\\nnum c := a * b; // c = 8/15\\nnum d := 1.6 / 3; // d = 8/15\\n```\\n\\nSome operations are:\\n\\n- Addition: `+`;\\n- Subtraction: `-`;\\n- Multiplication: `*`;\\n- Division: `/`;\\n- Exponentiation: `^`;\\n- Assignment: `:=`;\\n- Equality: `=`, `==`;\\n- Inequality: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`.\\n\\nAny function with two parameters can be used as a binary operator.\\n\\n```java\\nsquaresum := (num a, num b) => a^2 + b^2;\\n\\nnum c := 1 squaresum 2; // c = 5\\n```\\n\\nA number literal followed by a variable is infered to be a multiplication.\\n\\n```java\\nnum x := 2;\\nnum a := 3x^2 + 2x + 1; // a = 17\\n```\\n\\n## Declaring sequences\\n\\n```java\\nseq a := i => i^2; // a = 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...\\n```\\n\\n**Sequences are functions.** More specifically, a sequence is defined as\\n\\n```java\\ntype seq := (num) => T;\\n```\\n\\nwhere the only parameter is the subscript. Unlike vectors, sequences contain an infinite number of items. `a_i` is just a syntax sugar to `a(i)` as in a function. For collections of finite number of objects, use vectors.\\n\\n## Iterating sequences\\n\\nThe syntax `i...j` returns an iterator from `i` to `j`, inclusive. This is akin to `range(i, j)` in Python.\\n\\nWhen an iterator is used in the index, it also returns an iterator.\\n\\n```java\\nseq a := i => i;\\nfor (k in a_(1...3)) {\\n    print(k); // Out: 1 2 3\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Matrix operations\\n\\nAny typical matrix operation is supported. Moreover mathematical functions treat square matrices the same as numbers.\\n\\n```java\\nmat a := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9));\\nmat b := cos(a);\\n/**\\nb = (( 0.38017732968947, \u22120.3738301457419 , \u22120.12783762117329),\\n     (\u22120.53120649276402,  0.39010533372492, \u22120.68858283978612),\\n     (\u22120.44259031521749, \u22120.84595918680825, \u22120.24932805839901))\\n*/\\n```\\n\\n## Expressions\\n\\nExpressions are syntax sugars for functions.\\n\\n```java\\ntype expr := (...T) => T;\\n```\\n\\nThis is to reduce the cumbersome typing. A type like `(num, vec) => num` can now be simply `expr`. However, I\'m not sure how robustness / type safety can be achieved in this case.\\n\\n## Mathematical functions\\n\\nIn mathematics, parameters used in functions often appear like currying to me. For example, $\\\\sum_{k=0}^{10}k^2$ is just a function $\\\\sum_{k=0}^{10}$ applied to an expression $k^2$.\\n\\nI propose the angle brackets be used to pass parameters to functions that return a function, while round brackets are for functions that return a value.\\n\\n```java\\nsum := <num i, num j> => {\\n    return (expr f) => {\\n        num s := 0;\\n        for (x in i...j) {\\n            s += f(x);\\n        }\\n        return s;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nnum a = sum<1, 10>(x => x^2); // a = 385\\n```\\n\\n## Immutability\\n\\nAlthough appearing to be a functional programming language, everything is by default mutable. Immutable objects have `const` modifiers."},{"id":"/2021/04/01/zhi","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/04/01/zhi","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-01-zhi.mdx","title":"A thousand words with

As an absolute newcomer in backend, I had zero idea how I should start the app.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe first thing I tried was running the `index.php` file, which just printed out the HTML file in the console. Definitely not working\u2014it\'s analogous to opening the `index.html` file of a Vue app. You have to actually start an HTTPS service on the localhost.\\n\\n## Install dependencies\\n\\nRecall how a Vue app is run with yarn.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ yarn install\\n$ yarn serve\\n```\\n\\nWell, in Laravel, things are quite similar. The package manager used is **composer**, and I installed it globally following instructions [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally). We install the dependencies declared in `composer.json`.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ composer --version\\nComposer version 1.10.13 2020-09-09 11:46:34\\n$ composer install\\n```\\n\\n## Configure environment\\n\\nNext, we have to declare the environment. This is the first nuance between a front end project and a back end project. Because the Vue app is run in a browser, you don\'t worry so much about communicating with the outside. (You are in a sandbox anyways and you access everything through URLs.) But in the back end, the app has to reach out to the server, to the data base, and to all kinds of resources. For the sake of this project, we will configure the app environment and the database connection.\\n\\nLaravel comes with a sample environment file `.env.example`. Duplicate it and rename it `.env`. Then change the first two blocks.\\n\\n```text title=\\".env\\" {1}\\nAPP_NAME=sam\\nAPP_ENV=local\\nAPP_KEY=\\nAPP_DEBUG=true\\nAPP_LOG_LEVEL=debug\\nAPP_URL=http://localhost\\n```\\n\\nThe field left empty in the environment is `APP_KEY`, which is used for encrypted services. Generate one using artisan.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ php artisan key:generate\\nApplication key [base64:yPl2zp1+ZCZ1/7TK8QEM1uQTzOetXp8pl+/bTnbLAuw=] set successfully.\\n```\\n\\n## Configure database\\n\\nWe move to the database part.\\n\\n```text title=\\".env\\" {4-6}\\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\\nDB_PORT=3306\\nDB_DATABASE=sam\\nDB_USERNAME=root\\nDB_PASSWORD=[the root password]\\n```\\n\\nI know that in production I\'d better not use `root` to manage the database for security concerns, but it\'s development anyways, so I chose the easier path. Now, login to MySQL and create a database.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ mysql -u root -p\\nEnter password:\\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.

Each logo looks good by itself; the problem, though, is that they don\'t fit together. Consider the fact that there are four shades of red, three shades of yellow, and a whole range of blue. Plus, some logos are shaded (PHP and the three shields), while others are flat. The result is a hotchpotch of different designs and styles with no unified theme.\\n\\nPutting it into a bigger context, one realize that the entire website is built with the theme color <span style={{backgroundColor: \'#39cac4\', padding: \'2pt\', borderRadius: \'4pt\', color: \'black\'}}>turquoise</span>, which is also used in the other feature pictures. However, we observe zero use of this color in the collage. That makes it inconsistent with the page as a whole.\\n\\nThe solution, therefore, is to re-design the picture and fine-tune each color. I hypothesize that the most harmonic color palette should be one that has colors of uniform saturation and value on the HSV scale (a.k.a. equidistant to the center on the color wheel); hence I picked 12 colors evenly distributed on the circle.\\n\\n![](./Color.svg)\\n\\nThere is only one painful thing: the purple color that PHP uses has a saturation too low to be approximated with any of the colors on that circle.

Copying & pasting all text and re-typesetting was pretty standard task, but it became tricky when it came to the pictures. Look at [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/15D5f4zl5FG7Azl7gcZrxg), for example. (The localized version is <a href=\\"/docs/Science/cavalieri\\">here</a>.)\\n\\nSo I was trying to embed the first picture. Initially, to save bandwidth and some GH pages storage space (I try to be as nice to the server as possible, although later I realized that the 200 pictures took up less than half a gigabyte), I planned to link the URL directly, something like:\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"/docs/science/cavalieri.md\\"\\nexport const Figure = ({children, src}) => (\\n    <div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n        <img src={src} />\\n        <p style={{color: \'gray\', fontSize: \'small\'}}>{children}</p>\\n    </div>);\\n\\n...\\n\\n<Figure src=\\"https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/JGibibkelET68EfhySWuOboVia7FJX8ehwIAicTz2be2JDN7HIibwibjrpYPP1bTCr1TrjDicauU0P6BLCgFIibZK42GCQ/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1\\"></Figure>\\n```\\n\\nBut it turned up as:\\n\\n![Oops](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/JGibibkelET6ic8fRiawIMic3jFWfS9o4SpMyc12XdWAmKlWL8hXbgTZcwwksxJaibMcUuXI8z0cKibBVyrTH2Y8DFFfA/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)\\n\\n(The tricky part is it doesn\'t fail on all occasions. For example, it shows up on my localhost. I hope it fails on the GH pages so I don\'t look like a nut.)\\n\\nIt turns out that Weixin\'s image host doesn\'t like outside users sneaking into it. After some struggling, I made up my mind to host all images locally.\\n\\nAt this time, I already have all images inserted in the documents as `<Figure>` tags. The next steps are:\\n\\n1. Download all images by the URLs and put them in the correct folders (I want to keep some sort of structure although everything is looked after by the script);\\n2. Change the references of each image to a local URL.\\n\\nThe first thing coming to my mind was a bash script. Sadly, my knowledge of Bash was limited to invoking command-line tools like `yarn` or `python`\u2014no conditionals, no loops, no variables. So writing each line was a 5-minute StackOverflow search. (A huge thank-you to StackOverflow and all of the amazing contributors!)\\n\\n## Downloading images\\n\\nThe core module is probably one line:\\n\\n```bash\\nwget --output-document=\\"correct/path/file.png\\" \'https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/JGibibkelET68EfhySWuOboVia7FJX8ehwIAicTz2be2JDN7HIibwibjrpYPP1bTCr1TrjDicauU0P6BLCgFIibZK42GCQ/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1\'\\n```\\n\\nSo two problems:\\n\\n1. How do I generate the `correct/path/file.png`?\\n2. How do I locate all URLs?\\n\\nTo write the logic with pseudocode:\\n\\n```python\\nFILE[] files = enumerateFilesUnderPath(\\"./docs/\\")\\nfor file in files:\\n    imagePath = \\"./static/img/\\" + removeExtension(file.path)\\n    makeDirectory(imagePath)\\n    string[] links = file.findInFile(/\\"(?<=<Figure src=\\\\\\").*?(?=\\\\\\">)\\"/g)\\n    for link in links:\\n        imageName = makeSomeMeaningfulName(link)\\n        downloadImage(link, imageName, imagePath)\\n```\\n\\nTo begin with, I will need to enumerate all files within the `/docs` folder. This is done via the `find` command. The result is stored in a list.\\n\\n```bash\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\n```\\n\\nNext, we traverse `doc_list` which contains path to each document. We have the weird syntax `${doc_list[@]}` instead of the more intuitive `${doc_list}` (referencing the `doc_list` variable itself) as one would expect with knowledge of JS or Python\'s for-each loop.\\n\\n```bash {2-5}\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\nfor doc in \\"${doc_list[@]}\\"\\ndo\\n    # TODO\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nNow given the path to a `doc`, we need to generate its respective assets folder in the `static` directory. The `doc` path looks like: `docs/Science/cavalieri.md`. We trim out the file name without the extension `.md` by the syntax `\\"${doc%.*}`, and append the path `./static/img/`, getting the right directory path `./static/img/docs/Science/cavalieri` to put the images in. The folder creation is done with `mkdir`.\\n\\n```bash {4}\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\nfor doc in \\"${doc_list[@]}\\"\\ndo\\n    mkdir -p \\"./static/img/\\"\\"${doc%.*}\\"\\n    # TODO\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nRunning the script now will give a correct folder hierarchy without any contents.\\n\\nNext, we extract all URLs from the file. Searching in a file with a regex is done using the command `grep`. All URLs are enclosed in the format: `<Figure src=\\"...\\">`, so the most natural way is to use regex lookahead and lookbehind. Unluckily, `grep` on MacOS doesn\'t support Perl, so to use the `-p` flag, I had to install `grep` that provides the GNU-style `ggrep`. Now we can grep out all the links.\\n\\n```bash {5}\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\nfor doc in \\"${doc_list[@]}\\"\\ndo\\n    mkdir -p \\"./static/img/\\"\\"${doc%.*}\\"\\n    links=( $(ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=<Figure src=\\\\\\").*?(?=\\\\\\">)\\" \\"$doc\\") )\\n    # TODO\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nTo further extract the identifier for each image (the base-64 string) and the extension, we have to run `grep` on each string.\\n\\n```bash {6-11}\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\nfor doc in \\"${doc_list[@]}\\"\\ndo\\n    mkdir -p \\"./static/img/\\"\\"${doc%.*}\\"\\n    links=( $(ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=<Figure src=\\\\\\").*?(?=\\\\\\">)\\" \\"$doc\\") )\\n    for link in \\"${links[@]}\\"\\n    do\\n        name=$(echo \\"$link\\" | ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=(jpg|png)/).*(?=/640)\\")\\n        ext=$(echo \\"$link\\" | ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=wx_fmt=).*\\")\\n        # Almost there!\\n    done\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nLastly, it\'s just the `wget` that downloads the image from the link and saves it to the path given by the directory, image name (base-64 identifier), and image extension.\\n\\n```bash {10}\\ndoc_list=( $(find ./docs -mindepth 2) )\\nfor doc in \\"${doc_list[@]}\\"\\ndo\\n    mkdir -p \\"./static/img/\\"\\"${doc%.*}\\"\\n    links=( $(ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=<Figure src=\\\\\\").*?(?=\\\\\\">)\\" \\"$doc\\") )\\n    for link in \\"${links[@]}\\"\\n    do\\n        name=$(echo \\"$link\\" | ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=(jpg|png)/).*(?=/640)\\")\\n        ext=$(echo \\"$link\\" | ggrep -o -P \\"(?<=wx_fmt=).*\\")\\n        wget --output-document=\\"./static/img/\\"\\"${doc%.*}\\"\\"/\\"$name\\".\\"$ext \\"$link\\"\\n    done\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! Run it, and see the cascade of outputs.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/2021-03-11/Script.png\\"></img>\\n\\n## Changing URLs\\n\\nAfter we\'ve downloaded the images, we will change the references to local URLs. For example,\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"/docs/science/cavalieri.md\\"\\n<Figure src=\\"https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/JGibibkelET68EfhySWuOboVia7FJX8ehwIAicTz2be2JDN7HIibwibjrpYPP1bTCr1TrjDicauU0P6BLCgFIibZK42GCQ/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1\\"></Figure>\\n```\\n\\nbecomes\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"/docs/science/cavalieri.md\\"\\n<Figure src=\\"/img/docs/Science/cavalieri/JGibibkelET68EfhySWuOboVia7FJX8ehwIAicTz2be2JDN7HIibwibjrpYPP1bTCr1TrjDicauU0P6BLCgFIibZK42GCQ.png\\"></Figure>\\n```\\n\\nWell, given the commands introduced above, this task is pretty trivial. Modifying the content of a text file (like a search-and-replace) is done by the command `sed`. Because I\'m getting tired, this part is left as exercise. You can cheat and look at the code [here](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Personal-page/blob/master/scripts/changeUrl.sh)."},{"id":"/2021/03/09/docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/03/09/docusaurus","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-09-docusaurus/index.mdx","title":"Building a docusaurus app","description":"I switched to Docusaurus in March as framework for this website.

This blog summarizes my experience.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why Docusaurus?\\n\\nThe dark period when this website was built with Vue is crucified for eternity in the [git history of the GH pages repo](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Personal-page/tree/202beb7770e17fbc6ab30bce4d928bf678ecc5e8).\\n\\n![](./page.jpg)\\n\\nWell, I\'m not condemning Vue\u2014it is powerful. Powerful, indeed, since you can virtually build anything off it. The school club administration system that I\'m currently developing uses Vue for front-end, for example. The blame is probably on me, that I don\'t have much time to spare to build everything from scratch.\\n\\nI initially chose Vue for three reasons, and had I begun with React, I probably would have the same arguments:\\n\\n1. I planned to showcase several of my earlier works, including [Todo list](https://github.com/Computerization/New-member-practice-commit/tree/master/2019/Josh-Cena/Joshua-Todolist%20with%20vue) and [Math editor](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Web-math-editor), which are both built with Vue. I can easily import them as modules if the entire website is Vue-based.\\n2. I was just learning Vue-CLI at the time, and building the personal website becomes the perfect opportunity for some hands-on experience.\\n3. I enjoyed have high degree of control over the page design, like where to put each component and sizing.\\n\\nBut problems soon emerged. To name a few:\\n\\n1. Vue is simply not the best for purely static contents. It doesn\'t support Markdown out-of-the-box. To build the simple blog module, I had to build each blog post as HTML components and import them one-by-one\u2014a lot of messy code created in this process.\\n2. I failed to set up auto deployment. CI constantly failed, and the [official documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#platform-guides) didn\'t help much with handling CircleCI, the CI/CD app I\'m using. **This is not Vue\'s problem, but mine.** I just want some paradigm that I can directly copy from, which unfortunately was not available.\\n3. I don\'t have much experience with UI designs. The hard-coded CSS that looks good on a computer screen becomes messed up on a mobile screen. In addition, the UI framework Vuetify was too profound to work with.\\n\\nIn short, I want a tool that I can spend 30 minutes building _something_, not spending 30 days building _everything_. Docusaurus is good in this respect for its rapid development.\\n\\nI\'ve already built two docusaurus apps. The homepage for [our Computerization club](https://computerization.io), and the homepage for the [Baterock server](https://baterock-minecraft.github.io). They had the exact same tech stack, so there indeed exists a paradigm that I can readily use.\\n\\nMaybe I shouldn\'t have compared Vue with Docusaurus, just like one won\'t compare a knife to a fork, but I was simply illustrating the point of my migration to Docusaurus. It supported hosting Markdown documents, and also exposed React APIs to build other components. However, I did have to learn React since I\'ve always worked with Vue, and the striking difference between Vue and React may be yet another topic worth reflecting on. (And that might be a holy war worth fighting. In this war I still stand with Vue.)\\n\\nI still don\'t know if Docusaurus is the best tool to use for a personal webpage (for example, several people I know use Wordpress), but I decided to stick to what I\'m familiar with. The primary purpose of Docusaurus, in fact, is to host documentation for open-source projects, hence the word _\\"Doc\\"_-usaurus. But it looks equally good for hosting articles and blog posts.\\n\\n## Building the app\\n\\nI spent 500 words talking about nonsense. Now, onto some tech stuff. Initiating a Docusaurus project is just:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npx @docusaurus/init@latest init personal-page classic\\n$ yarn install\\n$ yarn start\\n```\\n\\nAnd then there\'s lots of customization to be made. Docusaurus has dummy contents scattered everywhere, and it will take some time hunting them all down. Take a look at [this commit](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Personal-page/commit/a5f2566068a5f915b75b39f8aabfe139f58125ef) for most of the work that needs to be done. A short checklist:\\n\\n1. Remove all pre-existing docs and blogs and add some real contents. Modify `/sidebars.js` as needed.\\n2. Select a theme color for the page. I used `#39cac4`, reason given in the <a href=\\"/profile/\\">profile</a>. Consult [this tool](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#styling-your-site-with-infima) for different shades, and paste them in `/src/css/custom.css`.\\n3. Draw a logo for the webpage. Most might use the GitHub avatar or a photo, but I did draw a logo which _then_ became my new GitHub avatar. If you wish, re-draw the feature images on the front page as well.\\n4. Browse through `/docusaurus.config.js` line-by-line and make necessary modifications.\\n5. Browse through `/src/pages/index.js` line-by-line and make necessary modifications.\\n6. To enable TypeScript support, run `yarn add @docusaurus/module-type-aliases`. Then add the file to the root:\\n\\n```typescript title=\\"types.d.ts\\"\\n/// <reference types=\\"@docusaurus/module-type-aliases\\" />\\n```\\n\\n7. $\\\\text{\\\\KaTeX}$ is a **must** for me. Add it by running\\n\\n```bash\\n$ yarn add rehype-katex\\n$ yarn add remark-math@3.0.1\\n```\\n\\nand adding\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"/docusaurus.config.js\\" {1-2,9-33,38-46}\\nconst remarkMath = require(\'remark-math\');\\nconst rehypeKatex = require(\'rehype-katex\');\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  title: \'Joshua Chen\',\\n\\n  ...\\n\\n  stylesheets: [\\n    {\\n      href: \'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.css\',\\n      type: \'text/css\',\\n      integrity:\\n        \'sha384-AfEj0r4/OFrOo5t7NnNe46zW/tFgW6x/bCJG8FqQCEo3+Aro6EYUG4+cU+KJWu/X\',\\n      crossorigin: \'anonymous\',\\n    },\\n  ],\\n  scripts: [\\n    {\\n      src: \'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.js\',\\n      integrity:\\n        \'sha384-g7c+Jr9ZivxKLnZTDUhnkOnsh30B4H0rpLUpJ4jAIKs4fnJI+sEnkvrMWph2EDg4\',\\n      crossorigin: \'anonymous\',\\n      defer: true,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      src: \'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/contrib/mhchem.min.js\',\\n      integrity:\\n        \'sha384-5gCAXJ0ZgozlShOzzT0OWArn7yCPGWVIvgo+BAd8NUKbCmulrJiQuCVR9cHlPHeG\',\\n      crossorigin: \'anonymous\',\\n      defer: true,\\n    },\\n  ],\\n  presets: [\\n    [\\n      \'@docusaurus/preset-classic\',\\n      {\\n        docs: {\\n          sidebarPath: require.resolve(\'./sidebars.js\'),\\n          remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],\\n          rehypePlugins: [[rehypeKatex, { strict: false }]],\\n        },\\n        blog: {\\n          remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],\\n          rehypePlugins: [[rehypeKatex, { strict: false }]],\\n        },\\n        theme: {\\n          customCss: require.resolve(\'./src/css/custom.css\'),\\n        },\\n      },\\n    ],\\n  ],\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI got the inspiration from https://docs.theochu.com/docusaurus/latex/. This may not be the most elegant way to do it, but it works. Sadly, until now I\'ve been unable to incorporate `mhchem` correctly, so `\\\\ce{}` still fails.\\n\\n## Deployment\\n\\nThe next step I did was setting up CI/CD. The CircleCI [configuration file](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Personal-page/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) is readily available. The only changes needed to be made are the git credentials and `environment` variables in `deploy-gh-pages`. Generate a personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Give it repo controls only and paste it into the CircleCI project settings > Environment Variables. And that\'s it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow we get a webpage already loaded with contents. The next step is to fill the `/docs/` and `/blog/` folders up, and writing some more pages with React. In the following posts, I plan to discuss:\\n\\n- Automating bulk file processing with bash scripts;\\n- TypeScript vs JavaScript;\\n- React components vs Vue components.\\n\\nEvery topic sounds very ambitious that I can write an epic on. I will try to make everything succint and to the point."},{"id":"/2021/02/27/hello","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/02/27/hello","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-27-hello.mdx","title":"Hello world!","description":"It was hard getting all these done, but now this webpage is all set \u2014 docusaurus is configured, auto CI is up, we have an organization account on GitHub to host this site...
