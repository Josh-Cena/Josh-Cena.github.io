The ultimate solution, the last defense. My best friend since 2500 trophies as my second legendary and my first level 10 card.

The perfect complement of mega knight. Shuts down any tank with ease, and has the second highest HP in this deck. When facing log bait, Mega knight + inferno dragon = tower down. It is simply satisfying seeing one inferno dragon draining out an entire tower."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Miner"),". Dig, dig, dig! Whenever you defend a mini-push with goblin gangs or bats, just send a miner to protect these swarms, and you get a workable counterpush. Using zap to make the opponent's princess tower lock on to the miner can usually make your crippled inferno dragon surprisingly take out an entire tower. It's even great on defense\u2014same damage as bandit or fisherman."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Skeleton barrel"),". The second offensive card on par with the miner. It can be used as a tank for swarms when the miner's not in hand, can kite air units, can be a small spell bait, can be used as a small spell itself against minion horde, and can even be used as a source of swarms against a PEKKA + Ewiz synthergy."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Goblin gang"),". Probably the best swarm card. Defends prince, dark prince, battle ram... It is a card you don't pay much attention to (unlike skarmy) but usually saves you at last minute."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Spear goblins"),". Cheap but versatile. Defends minion horde, goblin barrel, balloon, valkerie..."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Bats"),". Despite so many nerfs, it is still viable. Without a zap, snowball, or anti-air unit from the opponent, bats can take out most lone ground units. Mega knight + bats is always the best synthergy. (Except when facing graveyard, though, when you would rather pair mega knight with inferno dragon.)"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Zap"),". This is what makes a 5000 player different from a 7000 one. Snowball is cool on defense (better than the log IMO), but on offense zap is the best. Quickly clears swarms, makes your miner quickly take out a musketeer or wizard, resets inferno towers, makes the tower retarget, stuns the unit for 0.5 second...
