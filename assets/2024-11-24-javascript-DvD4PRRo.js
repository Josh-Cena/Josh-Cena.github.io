`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:[`Speaking of incentives, we all know that there are four parties involved in language design (as many languages with a formal standard do): the standard committee, implementers, users of the language (developers), and users of the software (end users). End users are definitely the top priority—no one can deny that. But JavaScript is in a unique situation where the implementer caters directly to the end users without the developers mediating. In this world, the committee and implementers each have their own agenda (the committee wants to enforce their own aesthetics; implementers want to maximize performance and maintain compatibility, so the browser doesn't appear "broken" to the user), and the developers' interest is put at the bottom. I'm not saying that developers `,e.jsx(t.em,{children:"don't"})," want things like strict type validation or a fast language, but the rest of us who occasionally want to have fun with the language are left with an uninteresting and rigid box with nothing to poke at. Given the heritage of JavaScript being flexible and dynamic, I think it's a huge loss to the ecosystem that this trend can't continue; after all, strictness can also be enforced in userland via linters and type checkers. A dynamic that prioritizes the developer needs would make the language as strict and lax as the user wants, instead of forcing the view of those in power on the entire ecosystem, assuming that the downstream developers don't know how to use the language properly."]}),`
