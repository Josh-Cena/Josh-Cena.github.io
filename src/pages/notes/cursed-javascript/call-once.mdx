# Functions that can only be called once â€” for immutable lovers

```js
function createOnceFunction(f) {
  return new (class extends class {} {
    constructor() {
      return (...args) => {
        super();
        return f(...args);
      };
    }
  })();
}
```

Usage:

```js
const f = createOnceFunction(() => console.log("Hello"));
f(); // Hello
f();
```
