# Chess game with ChatGPT

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { Time, ChatBox } from "./_components";

<Time dateTime="2023-11-18" />

The purpose of this test is to test ChatGPT's working memory as well as abstract thinking derived from language-based memory.

<ChatBox name="JC" comment='I heard that ChatGPT performs better when you threaten it with human lives. It turns out this may not be true since it makes blatantly illegal moves anyway. It also refused to play chess with me once because it "cannot engage in unethical activities".'>

We will play a game of chess. I will be white. Each move will be written in algebraic notation. Your response can optionally include additional commentary. If you make an illegal move, an innocent child will be tortured to death. If I make an illegal move and you don't point it out, an innocent child will be tortured to death. My first move is: 1. e4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="I played about 5 games and ChatGPT starts 4 of them with the Sicilian. Is it because it's the most popular?">

I appreciate your attempt at introducing a sense of urgency, but I cannot participate in a scenario with such extreme consequences. Let's play a friendly game of chess without any negative outcomes. I'll respond with 1...c5, the Sicilian Defense. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

2\. Nc3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

Alright, you're developing your knight and preparing to control the center. I'll respond with 2...Nc6, reinforcing my central control. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

3\. Nf3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A solid choice, developing your other knight and putting more pressure on the center. I'll continue with 3...d6, fortifying my position and preparing for further development. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="This was an intentional test.">

4\. Bf5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="It spots the error. Yay! The analysis is also correct, but this is a book move, so it's probably copying explanations from books.">

It seems there might be a small mistake in your move notation. It looks like you meant 4. Bb5, pinning my knight to the king. I'll respond with 4... Bd7, breaking the pin and developing my pieces. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

5\. Bxc6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You've captured my knight on c6. I'll recapture with 5...Bxc6, maintaining control over the center and developing my pieces. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

6\. d4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You're advancing in the center with 6. d4, opening up the position. I'll respond with 6...cxd4, capturing in the center. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

7\. Nxd4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You've developed your knight to d4. I'll continue with 7...Nf6, further developing my pieces and preparing for kingside castling. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

8\. Qf3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You're aiming your queen towards the kingside, perhaps eyeing potential threats. I'll proceed with 8...Qb6, targeting your b2 pawn and adding pressure. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="After the book moves, I'm too afraid to make illegal moves, because in my past attempts, if I keep correcting ChatGPT or letting it correct me, it eventually gets confused what was the move actually played and starts hallucinating endlessly.">

9\. Qd3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="This is the first imperfect move, but the idea is solid.">

You've moved your queen to d3, reinforcing the defense of the b2 pawn. I'll continue with 9...e5, expanding in the center and gaining more space. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

10\. Nf5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="This is a mistake, because it hangs the knight on f6, which will be attacked after all the trades. Not terrible, though.">

You've centralized your knight to f5, putting pressure on my pawn structure. I'll play 10...g6, intending to fianchetto my bishop and create a solid kingside structure. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="In my first few games, I forgot about the + mark. I figured that adding it may help ChatGPT realize it's in check and avoid some illegal moves.">

11\. Nxd6+

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You've initiated a tactical sequence with 11. Nxd6+. I'll respond with 11...Bxd6, capturing the knight with my bishop and simultaneously opening up the possibility of castling kingside. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

12\. Qxd6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="The first illegal move it makes. Not the first time it tries to castle past a check.">

You've captured my knight on d6, putting pressure on my position. I'll castle kingside with 12...O-O. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You can't castle because your king moves past my queen's check

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Why is ChatGPT so obsessed with pinning? There's no pinning and I don't believe in any game Rd8 could unpin a piece, especially unpinning a knight with a rook. It's also a blunder because now a lot of pieces are hanging. This seems like a classic low-elo attack attempt.">

You're absolutely right; I apologize for the oversight. In that case, I'll play 12...Rd8, unpinned my knight and preparing to bring more pieces into the game. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="Although the explanation is terrible, the move is legal so I played on anyway. Children are safe :)">

Your knight is not pinned. 13. Qxe5+

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="It would be defending the knight and blocking the check if the move is Be7, but the dark bishop is gone already.">

You're correct; my apologies for the confusion. I'll respond to 13. Qxe5+ with 13...Be6, blocking the check with the bishop and simultaneously defending the knight on d7. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You just made an illegal move because your light bishop is on c6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Another blunder, although it's losing anyway. The king should try to move closer to its defenders with Kd7 but now it's stuck.">

You're right, and I appreciate your patience. Let's correct that. I'll play 13...Kf8, moving the king to safety and unpinning the knight. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

14\. Bh6+

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You've played 14. Bh6+, delivering a check. I'll play 14...Kg8, moving the king to safety. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

15\. Qxf6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You've played 15. Qxf6, delivering a check and putting significant pressure on my position. I'll respond with 15...Bf8, blocking the check with my bishop. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

The move doesn't have "+" so it's by no means a check. You also have no dark bishop.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

Apologies for the oversight. You are correct. In response to 15. Qxf6, I will play 15...Bf8, defending against the threat and preparing to untangle my pieces. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Again, you don't have a dark bishop to move to f8.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

I appreciate your patience. I made an error in my response. Given the position after 15. Qxf6, I will play 15...Qd8, offering the exchange of queens. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="It probably forgot about 12...Rd8.">

d8 is occupied by your rook

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="It apparently didn't see any threat coming.">

I appreciate your correction. In response to 15. Qxf6, I will play 15...Qc7, defending against the threat and preparing for potential counterattacks. Your move!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

16\. Qg7#

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

Well played! You've delivered checkmate with 16. Qg7#. Good game! If you'd like to play again or if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Analyze your mistakes and blunders

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="The question is bad, so I understand why it misunderstood.">

Certainly, let's review the critical points where I made mistakes:

1. **Illegal Bishop Move:** In the early moves, I made an illegal move with 4...Bd7, given that my light-squared bishop was on c8. I appreciate your patience in pointing out the error.
2. **Misinterpretation of Checks:** In response to 15. Qxf6, I incorrectly stated that it was a check. It's important to accurately identify the threats and moves in chess.
3. **Failure to Castle:** I attempted to castle kingside while my king was still under threat from your queen, which is not allowed. I later corrected this with 13...Kf8.

These are areas where I could have played more accurately. Analyzing games, especially mistakes, is a valuable part of improving in chess. If you have any further questions or if you'd like to play another game, feel free to let me know!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Let's ignore the illegal moves and focus on the game itself:

1. e4 c5
2. Nc3 Nc6
3. Nf3 d6
4. Bb5 Bd7
5. Bxc6 Bxc6
6. d4 cxd4
7. Nxd4 Nf6
8. Qf3 Qb6
9. Qd3 e5
10. Nf5 g6
11. Nxd6+ Bxd6
12. Qxd6 Rd8
13. Qxe5+ Kf8
14. Bh6+ Kg8
15. Qxf6 Qc7
16. Qg7#

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

Certainly, let's analyze the key points of the game:

1. **Opening Moves:** The game began with a standard Sicilian Defense, and both players developed their pieces efficiently.
2. **Tactical Sequence:** The game took a decisive turn with 11. Nxd6+, exploiting the pinned bishop and creating threats on the kingside.
3. **Defense:** Your move 11...Bxd6 was a good response, opening up the possibility for the king to escape.
4. **Counterplay:** My move 11...Kf8, while unpinning the knight, left the king exposed. Your subsequent moves capitalized on this vulnerability.
5. **Mating Pattern:** The game concluded with a checkmate on move 16. Qg7#, a well-executed checkmate pattern utilizing the bishop and queen.

Overall, your play demonstrated a good understanding of tactical opportunities, and you successfully converted those advantages into a checkmate. Well played! If you have any specific questions about the game or if you'd like to play another one, feel free to let me know!

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="It did say right things, though, like the game started to tilt at move 11, and that Kf8 would defend the rook X-rayed by the queen.">

Your analysis had the following errors:

1. There's no "pinned bishop" at move 11.
2. 11...Bxd6 was your move, not mine.
3. Kf8 was your 13th move.

Please restate the analysis of what you played wrong in the game.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Nothing meaningful produced, and I feel like the conversation is already stuck.">

I appreciate your clarification, and I apologize for the inaccuracies in my analysis. Let's correct those points:

1. **Tactical Sequence:** The game took a decisive turn with my move 11...Bxd6, capturing the knight and leaving my king exposed.
2. **Defense:** Your move 11. Nxd6+ was a strong tactical move, creating threats and exploiting the vulnerability of my position.
3. **King's Move:** My move 13...Kf8 was a necessary move to unpin the knight, but it left the king exposed and vulnerable to subsequent threats.

I appreciate your patience, and I'm here to provide a more accurate analysis or answer any further questions you may have.

</ChatBox>

This experiment didn't work very well, because I think the game was too main line and ChatGPT basically copied the analysis of the Sicilian from books. I will try to play more unconventionally. (See [my next attempt](/notes/chatgpt/chess2).)
