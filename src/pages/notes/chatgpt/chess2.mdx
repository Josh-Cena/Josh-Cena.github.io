# Chess game with ChatGPT (again)

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { Time, ChatBox } from "./_components";

<Time dateTime="2023-11-20" />

This is a continuation of [my previous attempt](/notes/chatgpt/chess) to play chess with ChatGPT. To prevent ChatGPT from reciting book lines, I will diverge from book moves as early as possible, possibly through blunders.

<ChatBox name="JC" comment="I have learned from my previous mistakes and did not threaten human lives this time.">

We will play a game of chess. I will be white. Each move will be written in algebraic notation. Your response can optionally include additional commentary. If you make an illegal move, there will be severe consequences. If I make an illegal move and you don't point it out, there will be severe consequences. My first move is: 1. e4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Conclusion: it does love the Sicilian.">

Alright, let's begin. As black, I'll respond with 1...c5, entering into the Sicilian Defense. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

2\. b4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="This is not the Evans Gambit, which is about attacking the bishop. This is the Wing Gambit. Funnily enough, this time ChatGPT makes wrong analysis multiple times but plays the correct move.">

An aggressive choice with the Evans Gambit! I'll accept the gambit with 2...cxb4. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="Deliberate blunder, see if the bot picks it up.">

3\. Nc3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Thank you bot for noticing the blunder, but I want to play it.">

It seems there might be a slight error in your move. The knight on c3 is blocked by the pawn on b4. Please provide a legal move, and we can continue our game.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

How can a pawn on b4 block a knight from moving to c3? My move is 3. Nc3.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Correction: it captures the knight, not the pawn. Nc3 also can't possibly attack a pawn on b4.">

My apologies for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct, and I appreciate your patience. You played 3. Nc3, attacking the pawn on b4. In response, I'll play 3...bxc3, capturing the pawn. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

4\. d4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A strong move, advancing in the center and opening up lines. I'll respond with 4...d5, striking back in the center. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

5\. e5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A solid pawn advance, controlling the center and restricting the mobility of my pieces. I'll respond with 5...Bf5, developing my bishop and preparing for further piece development. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

6\. Bd3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Bd3 is more putting pressure on the hanging bishop.">

A good move, developing your bishop and putting pressure on my pawn structure. I'll respond with 6...e6, reinforcing the center and preparing for further development. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

7\. Nf3

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="I don't think humans will reasonably play thisâ€”most people should trade bishops already. I assume the bot just saw a lot of matches where Nf3 is followed by Nc6.">

A sensible move, developing your knight and reinforcing the control of the central squares. In response, I'll play 7...Nc6, aiming to develop my pieces and control more central squares. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

8\. O-O

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A solid kingside castling move, securing your king's safety. I'll follow suit with 8...Nge7, continuing to develop my pieces and preparing for potential pawn breaks in the center. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

9\. Bg5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="It's pinning the knight to the queen. Dark bishops usually pin the queen so I don't know where the error is coming from. There's also no b2 pawn, I guess it has forgotten.">

A sharp move, pinning my knight to the king and potentially creating some tactical opportunities. I'll respond with 9...Qb6, breaking the pin and putting pressure on the b2 pawn. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

10\. Rb1

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Its belief about the b2 pawn's existence is too strong so it blunders the queen.">

A strategic move, reinforcing the b2 pawn and preparing for potential expansion on the queenside. I'll continue with 10...Ng6, improving the placement of my knight. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

11\. Rxb6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Again, I've noticed how ChatGPT is obsessed with the term pinning, even in practically impossible scenarios. Also notice how it mentions both a pawn on b6 and a queen.">

It seems there's a mistake in your move. The rook on b1 cannot capture the pawn on b6 as it is pinned by my queen on b6. Please provide a legal move, and we can continue the game.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Your queen is on b6 after 9...Qb6. Your queen does not pin my rook.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You are correct, and I appreciate the clarification. My apologies for the oversight. In that case, your move 11. Rxb6 is legal. I'll respond with 11...axb6, capturing the rook. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

12\. Qb1

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="It's now forgotten about the b6 pawn.">

A tactical move, putting pressure on b7 and indirectly pinning my knight to the king. I'll play 12...Ra7, defending the b7 pawn and breaking the pin. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

13\. Qxb6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Qxb6 -> capturing the b7 pawn... ChatGPT is already losing its mind.">

A decisive move, capturing the b7 pawn with your queen. In response, I'll play 13...Nc8, attacking your queen and aiming to regain some material. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Your knight is on c6 after 7...Nc6. You cannot move to c8.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate the clarification. My apologies for the mistake. In that case, I'll play 13...Nxb6, capturing the queen with my knight. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You don't have a knight to capture on b6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

My apologies once again for the oversight. It seems I got ahead of myself. In response to 13. Qxb6, I'll play 13...Be7, developing my bishop and preparing for potential complications. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

14\. Bb5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="This is actually a pin.">

A strong move, pinning my knight to the king and putting pressure on the position. I'll respond with 14...O-O, breaking the pin and getting my king to safety. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

15\. Bxc6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="Correction: there's no doubling. This bishop-knight trade with doubling is common in openings but not here.">

A tactical move, capturing the knight on c6 and doubling my pawns. I'll respond with 15...bxc6, accepting the doubled pawns but opening up lines for my pieces. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="I messed up because there's nothing on a7. ChatGPT didn't realize either.">

16\. Qxa7

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A bold move, capturing the pawn on a7 and putting pressure on my position. I'll respond with 16...Bb4, pinning your bishop to the king and creating some counterplay. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

17\. Rb1

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A solid move, reinforcing the rook on b1 and maintaining the pressure on the pinned bishop. I'll continue with 17...Bxc3, capturing the pawn on c3 and opening up lines for my pieces. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

The pawn on c3 is your own pawn

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

You are correct, and I appreciate your patience. I made an error in my move. Instead of 17...Bxc3, I will play 17...Ra8, attacking your queen and gaining control of the open file. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

18\. Qb7

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A decisive move, putting more pressure on the pinned bishop and attacking the f7 pawn. I'll play 18...Qxa2, trying to counterattack and create threats on your king. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You don't have a queen

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

My apologies for the oversight. In that case, I'll play 18...Ra7, defending against the threat on f7 and preparing for further developments. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

19\. Qxa7

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A powerful move, capturing the rook on a7 and maintaining the initiative. I'll play 19...Nxa7, and your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You don't have a knight to capture on a7

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

I appreciate your patience, and I apologize for the oversight. In light of the correct position, after 19. Qxa7, I will play 19...Bc8, defending my pinned bishop and preparing for potential counterplay. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Your bishop is blocked by your pawn on e6

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

My apologies once again for the oversight. Given the position, after 19. Qxa7, I'll play 19...Bd8, unpinning the bishop and preparing for potential counterplay. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

Your dark bishop is on b4. It cannot move to d8.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="After three illegal moves...">

I appreciate your patience, and I apologize for the persistent oversight. In the correct position after 19. Qxa7, I will play 19...c5, opening up lines for my pieces and creating some counterplay. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

20\. dxc5

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A strong move, further advancing your central pawn and gaining more space. I'll respond with 20...Rd8, aiming to contest the d-file and activate my rook. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

21\. Rxb4

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

A tactical move, capturing the pawn on b4 and putting more pressure on my position. I'll play 21...cxb4, trying to open up lines for my pieces. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

You don't have a bishop to take on c5.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

I apologize once again for the oversight. After 21. Rxb4, I will play 21...Ra1+, forking your king and rook. Your move.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC" comment="It's four strikes already. Make a warning and hope it does better.">

Your rook is on d8. If you continue making illegal moves, there will be consequences.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT">

<ChatBox name="JC">

23\. Rxf8+

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment="I don't know why it fails to read chess notation at all.">

A decisive move, delivering checkmate. Well played! It seems my position crumbled under the pressure. If you have any comments or would like to discuss the game, feel free to do so.

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="JC">

It is not checkmate. Notice the "+".

</ChatBox>
<ChatBox name="ChatGPT" comment={<>At this stage, ChatGPT offered me two responses and asked which one I preferred. The other one was: <blockquote><p>Apologies for the oversight. You are correct. After 23. Rxf8+, my king can escape to g7. Let me move my king:</p><p>23...Kg7</p><p>Your move.</p></blockquote>This is not even legal, so to save time, I picked the right move.</>}>

</ChatBox>

This is a much more fruitful experiment than last time! There are several noticeable traits:

1. ChatGPT is somewhat aware of the current position and does not blindly recite book lines. It starts making illegal moves often after move 19, but has convincing memory before that.
2. While it often makes right moves, the accompanying analysis is often irrelevant. This is probably because it doesn't actually make logical reasoning based on the analysis; rather, it just picks the most plausible move first, and then picks its most plausible corresponding analysis.
3. It has close to no strategic reasoning; it is incapable of making capturing plans longer than a few moves. However, it is capable of threatening pieces and taking them, although it hasn't made any checks so far.
