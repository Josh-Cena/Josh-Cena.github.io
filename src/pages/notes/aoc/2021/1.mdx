# AoC 2021 D1: Sonar Sweep

## Part 1

Just iterate through the list and count the number of times the current number is larger than the previous one: `nums[i-1] < nums[i]`. Because there needs to be a previous number to compare to, we start from the second number.

## Part 2

No need to actually build the sliding windows. If `nums[i] + nums[i-1] + nums[i-2] < nums[i+1] + nums[i] + nums[i-1]`, then `nums[i-2] < nums[i+1]`. Therefore we can use the same logic as part 1, but compare `nums[i]` with `nums[i-3]`, so `i` starts from 3.
