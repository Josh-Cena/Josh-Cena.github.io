# AoC 2023 D2: Cube Conundrum

## Part 1

I parse each line as a list of lists, each list representing the count of R, G, and B cubes.

```R
parse_line <- function(line) {
  line <- strsplit(line, ": ")[[1]][2]
  line <- strsplit(line, "; ")[[1]]
  line <- sapply(line, function(x) {
    x <- strsplit(x, ", ")[[1]]
    counts <- list("red" = 0, "blue" = 0, "green" = 0)
    for (item in x) {
      parts <- strsplit(item, " ")[[1]]
      count <- as.numeric(parts[1])
      color <- parts[2]
      counts[[color]] <- counts[[color]] + count
    }
    counts
  })
  line
}
```

Figuring out how to index a structure like this is very, very difficult for me. It seems that `lines[[1]][, 1]` would return the R/G/B counts for the first round of the first game, etc., while `lines[[1]]["red", ]` would return the counts of red cubes for all rounds of the first game. Now I just need to check, for each line, if the count of each color and each round is in the expected range. The `which` function is very useful for this—especially since in R indices start from 1.

```R
solve1 <- function(data) {
  lines <- sapply(data, parse_line)
  valid <- sapply(lines, function(line) {
    all(line["red", ] <= 12 & line["green", ] <= 13 & line["blue", ] <= 14)
  })
  cat(sum(which(valid)), "\n")
}
```

## Part 2

For a game to be playable, the number of cubes must at least be the largest number drawn in a single round, which can be found by using `max` on `line["red", ]`, `line["green", ]`, and `line["blue", ]`. However because `line["red", ]` etc. are lists, I first need `unlist` to turn them into vectors.

```R
solve2 <- function(data) {
  lines <- sapply(data, parse_line)
  powers <- sapply(lines, function(line) {
    max(unlist(line["red", ])) *
      max(unlist(line["green", ])) *
      max(unlist(line["blue", ]))
  })
  cat(sum(powers), "\n")
}
```
