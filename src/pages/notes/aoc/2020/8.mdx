# Handheld Halting

## Part 1

Not much to say here; just iterate through the instructions, keeping track of which ones have been executed (as line numbers). If we reach an instruction we've already executed, return the accumulator.

## Part 2

There may be clever ways to do this, such as building a control flow graph and finding which `nop`/`jmp` instructions are on paths that lead to termination, but I brute-forced: for each `nop` or `jmp`, swap it, run the program, and see if it terminates. If it does, return the accumulator.
