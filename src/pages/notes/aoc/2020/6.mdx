# AoC 2020 D6: Custom Customs

import { FrontMatter, Footer } from "../_components";

<FrontMatter frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Part 1

Each group's answers is a list of sets. For part 1, if we want the questions _anyone_ answered "yes", that's the union of the sets in each list. Conveniently we can simply concatenate all the strings in the group (removing newlines) and convert that to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.

```python
sum(len(set(g.replace("\n", ""))) for g in groups)
```

## Part 2

Now we want the questions _everyone_ answered "yes", which is the intersection of the sets in each list. Python's `set.intersection` method can take multiple arguments, so we can unpack the list of sets with `*`:

```python
sum(len(set.intersection(*map(set, g.split("\n")))) for g in groups)
```

<Footer frontMatter={frontMatter} />
