# AoC 2020 D2: Password Philosophy

## Part 1

Nothing to say here. Just parse the input and check the counts.

```python
if count[0] <= password.count(char) <= count[1]:
    total += 1
```

## Part 2

The left position check is `password[ind_range[0] - 1] == char` and the right position check is `password[ind_range[1] - 1] == char`. We want exactly one of them to be true, so we can use `!=`.

```python
if (password[ind_range[0] - 1] == char) != (password[ind_range[1] - 1] == char):
    total += 1
```
