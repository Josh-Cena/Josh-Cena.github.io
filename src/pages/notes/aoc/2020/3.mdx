# Toboggan Trajectory

## Part 1

There may be smarter ways to do this, but I just simulated the movement of the toboggan. The map repeats infinitely to the right, so I used modulo to wrap around.

```python
cur = (0, 0)
total = 0
while cur[0] < len(grid):
    if grid[cur]:
        total += 1
    cur = (cur[0] + slope[0], (cur[1] + slope[1]) % len(grid[0]))
```

## Part 2

Just repeat part 1 for all slopes and multiply the results.
