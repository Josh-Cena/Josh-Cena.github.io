# Combo Breaker

I thought there would be some neat mathematical trick to this problem exploiting the weakness of the transformation function, but it seems that brute force works just fine??

```python
loop_size = 1
num = 7
while True:
    if num == num1:
        print(pow(num2, loop_size, 20201227))
        return
    num = (num * 7) % 20201227
    loop_size += 1
```

(By the way, this method of using $a^m \bmod p$ and $a^n \bmod p$ as public keys and $a^{mn} \bmod p$ as the shared secret is the [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).)
