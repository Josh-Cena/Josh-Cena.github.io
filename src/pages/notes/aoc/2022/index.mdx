# Advent of Code 2022 notes

import { YearHeader } from "../_components";

<YearHeader year={2022} />

2022 was my second year doing AoC. I was freshly in college and had time to spare. In early 2022, out of boredom after college application, and inspired by everyone raving about functional programming™, I decided to learn Haskell via [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell). AoC was a great way to try it out, especially since algorithm problems would involve far less fiddling with monads compared to IRL projects. I was very thankful for this experience: two years later, I took a [software analysis and verification](https://coursetable.com/catalog?course-modal=202403-10141) class where half of my projects were written in Haskell, and I was immediately at home.

Anyway, in 2022, I soon found out that I was inflicting pain on myself because I often have to wrap my head around doing things with tail recursion. BFS was intuitive to _read_ but not at all intuitive to _write_, at least when I was new. There were a lot of folds, a lot of states being passed around, and a lot of inconsistency in my code style (despite using HLint). For example, [7](./7.mdx) would have been a trivial problem in mutable languages but was a bit verbose and error-prone in Haskell. Nevertheless, I would rate 2022 very high on my "enjoyment" scale because the code was always extremely neat and concise—features I highly value. Towards the latter half, I became very familiar with the language and it stopped being a hindrance.

Difficulty-wise, I consider this year a significant hike from 2021. I bailed on [15](./15.mdx), when I couldn't see clearly how to model it mathematically. Even in hindsight, 15 was a particularly hard problem especially at this numbering. [16](./16.mdx) and [19](./19.mdx) were very challenging among DP problems, especially because the pruning strategies for 19 were not obvious. [18](./18.mdx) was not supposed to be a pain; half of the difficulty, IMO, came from using Haskell. [20](./20.mdx) is brute-forceable but was significantly sped up with an order statistic tree, which the 2022 me couldn't have known existed. On the upside though, 21–25 were all very approachable, although I was already intimidated and didn't come back (also I was traveling around).
