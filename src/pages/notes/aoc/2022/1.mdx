# AoC 2022 D1: Calorie Counting

## Part 1

Yes, yes, I know that finding the $k$th largest number in a list can be done in linear time with the [Quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect) algorithm, but given that the input has fewer than 300 elves, I decided to just sort the list and pick the first element.

```hs
getTops :: [Text] -> [Int]
getTops input = sortOn Down tops
  where
    tops = map (sumMap (read . T.unpack) . T.lines) $ splitT "\n\n" $ T.unlines input
```

## Part 2

The same function as above, just picking the first three elements instead of just the first. Again, if I used Quickselect, this would be $\mathcal{O}(n)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
