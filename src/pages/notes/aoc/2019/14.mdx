# AoC 2019 D14: Space Stoichiometry

## Part 1

Initially I simplified each recipe to "how much ORE is needed to produce 1 unit of X", but I realized that each reaction must be run in whole, so I need to account for leftovers. That is, if I have `10 ORE => 10 A` and I need 7 A, I have to run the reaction once and have 3 A left, instead of using 7 ORE directly. This also makes memoization a bit tricky, because the number of ORE not just depends on the target chemical and amount, but also the current leftovers. In the end I forewent memoization and just did a straightforward recursive implementation:

```cpp
long long num_ores(
    const std::map<std::string, Recipe> &recipes,
    const std::string &name,
    long long quantity,
    std::map<std::string, long long> &leftovers
);
```

## Part 2

This problem just screams "binary search", since the relationship between FUEL produced and ORE consumed is monotonic, and the search space is huge. We just bisect the range `[0, 1000000000000LL]` (1 fuel requires more than 1 trillion ORES to 1 fuel only requires 1 ORE), each time taking the left half if the midpoint is not feasible with `1000000000000LL` ores, and the right half otherwise. Technically we can shrink the range slightly, because we know that at least `1000000000000LL / ores_for_1_fuel` fuel can be produced, but it doesn't really matter, since 1 trillion is just 40 iterations of bisections.

```cpp
// [0..left] is feasible, [right..ore_cap] is not
long long left = 1;
long long right = ore_cap;
while (left <= right) {
    long long mid = (left + right) / 2;
    std::map<std::string, long long> leftovers;
    long long ores = num_ores(recipes, "FUEL", mid, leftovers);
    if (ores <= ore_cap) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        right = mid - 1;
    }
}
```
