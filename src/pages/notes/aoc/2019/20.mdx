# AoC 2019 D20: Donut Maze

import { FrontMatter, Footer } from "../_components";

## Part 1

This is a surprisingly simple problem compared to the amount of trouble of parsing the input. The first step is to find the positions of the portals. I first find the inner and outer edges of the donut, by iterating over the middle row until I go into empty space. Then I iterate over each inner/outer edge and check for uppercase letters adjacent to open spaces. Finally I build a bidirectional map of portals and their grid positions.

```cpp
std::map<std::pair<int, int>, int> pos_to_portal;
std::map<int, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>> portal_to_poss;
for (auto &[r, c, lvl, ch1, ch2] : donut_edges(data, width, height, donut_width)) {
    if (ch1 >= 'A' && ch1 <= 'Z' && ch2 >= 'A' && ch2 <= 'Z') {
        int code = portal_code(ch1, ch2);
        pos_to_portal[{r, c}] = code;
        portal_to_poss[code].emplace_back(r, c);
    }
}

std::pair<int, int> start_pos = portal_to_poss[portal_code('A', 'A')][0];
std::pair<int, int> end_pos = portal_to_poss[portal_code('Z', 'Z')][0];
// AA and ZZ aren't real portals
portal_to_poss.erase(portal_code('A', 'A'));
portal_to_poss.erase(portal_code('Z', 'Z'));
pos_to_portal.erase(start_pos);
pos_to_portal.erase(end_pos);
```

The rest is standard BFS: for each position, we can move in 4 directions, plus going through a portal if we are on one.

## Part 2

The same idea as part 1, except now the position is (row, column, level). The `portal_to_poss` map now maps to `(row, column, delta_level)`, where `delta_level` is `+1` for inner portals and `-1` for outer portals. When we go through a portal, we also update the level accordingly, and keep the level non-negative. The start and end positions are at level 0. Nothing else changes.

To share code, I made part 1 be based on this 3D state as well, just with `delta_level` always being 0.
