# AoC 2019 D8: Space Image Format

## Part 1

I don't even need to build an actual 3D array representing the image. I know that `width = 25` and `height = 6`, so I have `layer_size = width * height` and `num_layers = input.size() / layer_size`. Then I can iterate over `layer` and `i` and index into `input[layer * layer_size + i]`.

## Part 2

I built the image as a `vector<int>`, where each element is `2` (transparent) initially. Then I iterate over each layer and update the pixel in the image if it is still transparent. Finally I print it out by iterating over `0..height` and `0..width`. Originally I printed them backwards (`0` as `#` since it's "black"), but then I realized it's easier to read with `1` as `#` since the console background is black.

I take a second to admire the ASCII art:

```plain
#     ##  #   ##  # ###
#    #  # #   ##  # #  #
#    #     # # #### ###
#    # ##   #  #  # #  #
#    #  #   #  #  # #  #
####  ###   #  #  # ###
```
