# AoC 2019 D9: Sensor Boost

- To add support for relative mode, the `relative_base` is added to the `Program` class. Because `eval_param` and `write_to` now relies on two states: the memory and the relative base, I just make them member functions so they can directly access on `this`. Some other things are also incorporated into the class.
- All memory values are now `long long` instead of `int`.
- The memory is now a `map<long long, long long>` instead of a `vector<long long>`, so that the memory can be indexed at arbitrary addresses without greatly growing its physical size.
