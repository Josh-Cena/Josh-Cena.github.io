My deck is **Mega Knight Bait**, and it\'s almost dead right now in the meta.\\n\\n![Deck](./CR_deck.png)\\n\\nI picked up this deck in February, 2020, when I was at 4600 trophies. It dominated that arena since few opponents even had small spells. April was the paradise moment for this deck, when skeleton barrel got its speed buff\u2014it even rose to mid-meta. _(That was also the happiest period of my life!)_\\n\\nBut around July, I was almost giving up on this deck. I got crushed every time by valkeries, wizards, PEKKAs, anything. This deck is just weak on defense\u2014only four ground units, all air defense units prone to zaps and other spells, mega knight being the only control card; inconsistent on offense\u2014with one AOE unit from my opponent the entire push is shut down; and collecting three legendary cards was just an endless journey. I played mega knight miner wall breakers for one season (shortly after the prince and royal delivery buff, this deck was everywhere), but eventually switched back for no reason.\\n\\nI\'ve been playing this deck ever since\u2014not changing any card once. I did change my small spell from snowball to zap, though, in fear of all the skarmies and inferno towers around the arena, but never for any other card.\\n\\nAnd efforts payed back. I won CC 12 wins, season tournament 18 wins, etc., and consistently pushed further on ladder. Eventually when my inferno dragon was maxed, I reached 6K with my level 12 king tower. (It was so hard against goblin barrel decks! Mega knight bait already has a hard time against log bait.)\\n\\nSo to show my respect for this deck, let me announce the names of each card.\\n\\n- **Mega knight**. The ultimate solution, the last defense. My best friend since 2500 trophies as my second legendary and my first level 10 card. This is what makes this deck fundamentally different from other bait / cycle decks. 7 elixirs can easily shut down a 15-elixir push, and even save half of its HP for a counterpush if you back it up with anything!\\n- **Inferno dragon**. The perfect complement of mega knight. Shuts down any tank with ease, and has the second highest HP in this deck. When facing log bait, Mega knight + inferno dragon = tower down. It is simply satisfying seeing one inferno dragon draining out an entire tower.\\n- **Miner**. Dig, dig, dig! Whenever you defend a mini-push with goblin gangs or bats, just send a miner to protect these swarms, and you get a workable counterpush. Using zap to make the opponent\'s princess tower lock on to the miner can usually make your crippled inferno dragon surprisingly take out an entire tower. It\'s even great on defense\u2014same damage as bandit or fisherman.\\n- **Skeleton barrel**. The second offensive card on par with the miner. It can be used as a tank for swarms when the miner\'s not in hand, can kite air units, can be a small spell bait, can be used as a small spell itself against minion horde, and can even be used as a source of swarms against a PEKKA + Ewiz synthergy.\\n- **Goblin gang**. Probably the best swarm card. Defends prince, dark prince, battle ram... It is a card you don\'t pay much attention to (unlike skarmy) but usually saves you at last minute.\\n- **Spear goblins**. Cheap but versatile. Defends minion horde, goblin barrel, balloon, valkerie...\\n- **Bats**. Despite so many nerfs, it is still viable. Without a zap, snowball, or anti-air unit from the opponent, bats can take out most lone ground units. Mega knight + bats is always the best synthergy. (Except when facing graveyard, though, when you would rather pair mega knight with inferno dragon.)\\n- **Zap**. This is what makes a 5000 player different from a 7000 one. Snowball is cool on defense (better than the log IMO), but on offense zap is the best. Quickly clears swarms, makes your miner quickly take out a musketeer or wizard, resets inferno towers, makes the tower retarget, stuns the unit for 0.5 second... It is the X-factor in the game.\\n\\nNow that my goal of 6K is completed, the next milestones on my journey are:\\n\\n1. Level 13 king tower\\n2. Four maxed decks\\n3. 6300, 6600, 7000...\\n4. World ranking\\n5. GC 12 wins (I don\'t have many gems though)\\n\\nIt would not be an easy task, but I\'m on my way."},{"id":"/2021/04/25/lang","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-Hans/blog/2021/04/25/lang","source":"@site/i18n/zh-Hans/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-04-25-lang.mdx","title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u95e8\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u60f3\u6cd5","description":"I\'m just putting together some random thoughts that I wish to turn into a new programming language.

These are notations I often use in comments for C++ algorithms. A lot of the syntax may have been realized by mathematical languages like Mathematica or Python.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Data types\\n\\nThis is a language mainly used for algorithms and maths. The data types are:\\n\\n- **Number** `-1.6`, `1/3`;\\n- **Boolean** `true`;\\n- **String** `\\"Hello\\"`;\\n- **Set** `{1, 2, 3}` (no duplicate value; no order);\\n- **Matrix** `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` (supports matrix operations; vectors are special names for n\xd71 or 1\xd7n matrices);\\n- **Function**.\\n\\n## Arithmetic\\n\\nApart from the typical integer and decimal types, number types also include **fractions**, **irrational numbers**, and **complex numbers**. The special number `infty` is used for sequence and function limits, as well as the result of division by zero.\\n\\nSince fractions preserve more precision than decimals, whenever a fraction is involved in an expression, the result will be a fraction. Integers are special fractions with denominator of 1.\\n\\n```java\\nnum a := 1.6;\\nnum b := 1/3;\\nnum c := a * b; // c = 8/15\\nnum d := 1.6 / 3; // d = 8/15\\n```\\n\\nSome operations are:\\n\\n- Addition: `+`;\\n- Subtraction: `-`;\\n- Multiplication: `*`;\\n- Division: `/`;\\n- Exponentiation: `^`;\\n- Assignment: `:=`;\\n- Equality: `=`, `==`;\\n- Inequality: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`.\\n\\nAny function with two parameters can be used as a binary operator.\\n\\n```java\\nsquaresum := (num a, num b) => a^2 + b^2;\\n\\nnum c := 1 squaresum 2; // c = 5\\n```\\n\\nA number literal followed by a variable is infered to be a multiplication.\\n\\n```java\\nnum x := 2;\\nnum a := 3x^2 + 2x + 1; // a = 17\\n```\\n\\n## Declaring sequences\\n\\n```java\\nseq a := i => i^2; // a = 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...\\n```\\n\\n**Sequences are functions.** More specifically, a sequence is defined as\\n\\n```java\\ntype seq := (num) => T;\\n```\\n\\nwhere the only parameter is the subscript. Unlike vectors, sequences contain an infinite number of items. `a_i` is just a syntax sugar to `a(i)` as in a function. For collections of finite number of objects, use vectors.\\n\\n## Iterating sequences\\n\\nThe syntax `i...j` returns an iterator from `i` to `j`, inclusive. This is akin to `range(i, j)` in Python.\\n\\nWhen an iterator is used in the index, it also returns an iterator.\\n\\n```java\\nseq a := i => i;\\nfor (k in a_(1...3)) {\\n    print(k); // Out: 1 2 3\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Matrix operations\\n\\nAny typical matrix operation is supported. Moreover mathematical functions treat square matrices the same as numbers.\\n\\n```java\\nmat a := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9));\\nmat b := cos(a);\\n/**\\nb = (( 0.38017732968947, \u22120.3738301457419 , \u22120.12783762117329),\\n     (\u22120.53120649276402,  0.39010533372492, \u22120.68858283978612),\\n     (\u22120.44259031521749, \u22120.84595918680825, \u22120.24932805839901))\\n*/\\n```\\n\\n## Expressions\\n\\nExpressions are syntax sugars for functions.\\n\\n```java\\ntype expr := (...T) => T;\\n```\\n\\nThis is to reduce the cumbersome typing. A type like `(num, vec) => num` can now be simply `expr`. However, I\'m not sure how robustness / type safety can be achieved in this case.\\n\\n## Mathematical functions\\n\\nIn mathematics, parameters used in functions often appear like currying to me. For example, $\\\\sum_{k=0}^{10}k^2$ is just a function $\\\\sum_{k=0}^{10}$ applied to an expression $k^2$.\\n\\nI propose the angle brackets be used to pass parameters to functions that return a function, while round brackets are for functions that return a value.\\n\\n```java\\nsum := <num i, num j> => {\\n    return (expr f) => {\\n        num s := 0;\\n        for (x in i...j) {\\n            s += f(x);\\n        }\\n        return s;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nnum a = sum<1, 10>(x => x^2); // a = 385\\n```\\n\\n## Immutability\\n\\nAlthough appearing to be a functional programming language, everything is by default mutable. Immutable objects have `const` modifiers."},{"id":"/2021/04/01/zhi","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-Hans/blog/2021/04/01/zhi","source":"@site/i18n/zh-Hans/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-04-01-zhi.mdx","title":"\u5343\u5f58\u6587","description":"\u611a\u4eba\u8282\u5feb\u4e50\uff01","date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e744\u67081\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"\u7efc\u5408","permalink":"/zh-Hans/blog/tags/\u7efc\u5408"}],"readingTime":25,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"\u9648\u601d\u8fbe","url":"https://github.com/Josh-Cena","imageURL":"https://github.com/Josh-Cena.png","key":"joshcena"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\u5343\u5f58\u6587","authors":"joshcena","tags":["\u7efc\u5408"]},"prevItem":{"title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u95e8\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u60f3\u6cd5","permalink":"/zh-Hans/blog/2021/04/25/lang"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u8fd0\u884c
