Despite so many nerfs, it is still viable. Without a zap, snowball, or anti-air unit from the opponent, bats can take out most lone ground units. Mega knight + bats is always the best synthergy.

This is what makes a 5000 player different from a 7000 one. Snowball is cool on defense (better than the log IMO), but on offense zap is the best.
